# C Project README

This project contains a series of C programs that demonstrate basic programming concepts such as random number generation, character printing, and number manipulation. Below is a description of each task along with the corresponding filenames.

## Tasks Overview

### 0-positive_or_negative.c
**Filename:** `0-positive_or_negative.c`  
**Description:** This program assigns a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed. It then prints whether the number stored in `n` is positive, negative, or zero.

### 1-last_digit.c
**Filename:** `1-last_digit.c`  
**Description:** This program assigns a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed. It prints the last digit of the number stored in `n`, providing insight into number manipulation.

### 2-print_alphabet.c
**Filename:** `2-print_alphabet.c`  
**Description:** This program prints the lowercase alphabet from 'a' to 'z', followed by a new line. It demonstrates basic output functionality using loops.

### 3-print_alphabets.c
**Filename:** `3-print_alphabets.c`  
**Description:** This program prints the lowercase alphabet followed by the uppercase alphabet, followed by a new line. It showcases character printing in both cases.

### 4-print_alphabt.c
**Filename:** `4-print_alphabt.c`  
**Description:** This program prints the lowercase alphabet from 'a' to 'z', excluding the letters 'q' and 'e', followed by a new line. It highlights filtering of specific characters.

### 5-print_numbers.c
**Filename:** `5-print_numbers.c`  
**Description:** This program prints all single-digit numbers of base 10, starting from 0 and ending at 9, followed by a new line. It emphasizes basic numeric output.

### 6-print_numberz.c
**Filename:** `6-print_numberz.c`  
**Description:** Similar to `5-print_numbers.c`, this program prints all single-digit numbers of base 10 from 0 to 9, but uses a different approach (using `putchar`) to achieve the output.

### 7-print_tebahpla.c
**Filename:** `7-print_tebahpla.c`  
**Description:** This program prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse order from 'z' to 'a', followed by a new line. It demonstrates reverse iteration through characters.

### 8-print_base16.c
**Filename:** `8-print_base16.c`  
**Description:** This program prints all the numbers of base 16 (hexadecimal) in lowercase, from 0 to f, followed by a new line. It shows how to represent numbers in different bases.

### 9-print_comb.c
**Filename:** `9-print_comb.c`  
**Description:** This program prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers (0 to 9), ensuring that each combination is unique and formatted correctly. It highlights combinatorial logic in output.

## Usage
To run these programs, compile each `.c` file using a C compiler (e.g., `gcc`) and execute the resulting binary. Each program demonstrates a different aspect of C programming.
