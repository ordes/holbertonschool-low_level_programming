# C Project: Task Descriptions

This project contains several tasks implemented in C. Each task is contained within a separate file, and each file contains a function that performs a specific operation.

## Tasks

### 0. `sum_them_all.c`
**Description**:  
This task requires the implementation of a function that calculates and returns the sum of all its parameters.

**Function**:  
`int sum_them_all(const unsigned int n, ...)`  
- The function takes a variable number of arguments (`n` indicates the number of arguments), and returns the sum of all the arguments.

---

### 1. `print_numbers.c`
**Description**:  
This task requires a function that prints numbers from `0` to `9`, followed by a new line.

**Function**:  
`void print_numbers(void)`  
- The function prints the numbers `0` through `9`, followed by a new line.

### 2. `print_strings.c`
**Description**:  
This task requires a function that prints a list of strings, followed by a new line.

**Function**:  
`void print_strings(const char *str, ...)`  
- The function takes multiple string arguments and prints each string, followed by a new line.

### 3. `print_all.c`
**Description**:  
This task requires a function that prints anything (i.e., any data type), with the type of data passed to the function being dynamically determined.
