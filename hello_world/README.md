# C Project README

This project consists of several scripts and C programs designed to assist with the compilation and execution of C code. Below is a brief description of each task along with the corresponding filenames.

## Tasks Overview

### 0-preprocessor
**Filename:** `0-preprocessor`  
**Description:** This script runs a specified C file through the preprocessor, processing directives such as macros and file inclusions, and saves the output to another file. This step prepares the code for the next stages of compilation.

### 1-compiler
**Filename:** `1-compiler`  
**Description:** This script compiles a specified C file into an object file without linking. The output is a `.o` file, enabling separate compilation and subsequent linking to create an executable.

### 2-assembler
**Filename:** `2-assembler`  
**Description:** This script generates assembly code from a specified C file and saves it to an output file. This assembly code provides a low-level representation of the C code, which can be useful for debugging and optimization.

### 3-name
**Filename:** `3-name`  
**Description:** This script compiles a specified C file and creates an executable named `cisfun`. This simplifies the compilation process by automatically setting a specific output file name.

### 4-puts.c
**Filename:** `4-puts.c`  
**Description:** This C program prints the message:  
*"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle,"*  
followed by a new line. It demonstrates basic output functionality using the `puts` function.

### 5-printf.c
**Filename:** `5-printf.c`  
**Description:** This C program prints the message:  
*"with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,"*  
followed by a new line. It showcases formatted output using the `printf` function.

### 6-size.c
**Filename:** `6-size.c`  
**Description:** This C program prints the size of various data types on the computer where it is compiled and run. It provides valuable insights into memory allocation and data type sizes in C.

## Usage
To execute the scripts and programs, ensure you have the necessary permissions. You can run each script from the terminal, providing the appropriate C file as an argument, or compile and run the C programs using a C compiler.
